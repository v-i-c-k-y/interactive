<p><small>♥i think pale powder and lulworth blue are my favorites, esp. in combination. have you heard chance’s song on the </br>hamilton soundtrack? it’s a little different from his other recent work.
	<hr>
hesitated to ask about jake after you left U.S, because i was hoping the distance would be vvvv helpful (and</br>mentioning him might duck it up)!! does it feel more permanent?
	<hr>
why cenotaphs?? i like the night sky idea—lots of continuity of that in your work</br>
    <hr>
the cool thing about lacking experience but developing critical thinking/understanding multiple lenses is that gaining</br> skills/experience CAN get done on the job, but having a liberal arts foundation doesnt happen anywhere other than</br> school? so i think you made the most of your time as a student. here’s an article i read recently, that made me rethink</br> a lot of my career insecurities: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/01/marie-kondo-fyre-fraud-and-tvs-millennial-burnout/580753/">www.theatlantic.com</a>

i’ve been OK i guess? my apologies for dropping off the face of the universe lol. there were lots of shopping period</br> rejections (classes i thought i’d get, that i didn’t—sometimes my fault for not emailing over break, oftentimes just bad</br> luck). i feel on top of my design jobs, but i think it made me really sensitive to moments where i’d come home (ready to</br> introvert) and there were like 3+ people on our couch. so a weird mix of hypercontrol in class/work/applications, and</br> less control with social stuff. definitely ended up cutting virtual communication down to compensate, but you’re my</br> most not-exhausting friend (introvertz!! music! art!) so it didn’t help me to NOT talk to you
    <hr>
i think ____ will probably push our meet-up back, because we tentatively agreed on next weekend, but he mentioned a</br> call-back, and now i think he’s putting off texting me about it. it doesn’t make me rethink the “see him in person, get</br> more info, then decide if you’re getting your needs met” approach, but it definitely doesn’t make me feel better about</br> the thing haha
    <hr>
