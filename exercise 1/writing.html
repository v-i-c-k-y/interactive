<p><small>♥i think pale powder and lulworth blue are my favorites, esp. in combination. have you heard chance’s song on the </br><font size="-1">hamilton soundtrack? it’s a little different from his other recent work.
	<hr>
<font size="-2">hesitated to ask about jake after you left U.S, because i was hoping the distance would be vvvv helpful (and</br><font size="-3">mentioning him might duck it up)!! does it feel more permanent?
	<hr>
<font size="-4">why cenotaphs?? i like the night sky idea—lots of continuity of that in your work
